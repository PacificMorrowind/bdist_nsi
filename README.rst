The bdist-nsi module extends Python's distutils module with a bdist_nsi 
setup command to create binary Windows installers for Python modules, 
based on NSIS. Thereby, bdist-nsi brings all the features of NSIS to 
Windows installers for Python modules, such as silent install, modern 
user interface, and internationalization.
